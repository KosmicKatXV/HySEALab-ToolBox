## What is HySeaLABS?
 The Hysea project, developed at the University of Malaga, offers specialized software to model tsunamis through advanced numerical methods, such as shallow water equations, which process large volumes of topographic and batimetric data. Due to the computational magnitude of these problems, Hysea simulations are executed in supercomputing environments, such as the Picasso supercomputer, managed by the UMA SCBI service or the atlantic supercomputer managed by the Edanya group and housed by the SCI of the UMA.

However, between these supercomputers and the researchers working at the Hysea project lies a technical knowledge gap which is currently hindering the proper use of these tools.

Therefore the purpose of this project is to develop an easy-to-use and accessible platform based on the JupyterLab application for researchers to develop their workloads on a dedicated server located at ETSIT.
# What is this?
Welcome! In this folder you will find a set of tools the community has been developing for other user to enjoy. They have been divided in a series of folders where each one might be developed by a user or bear a common theme.
# How can I contribute? 
[Here](https://github.com/KosmicKatXV/HySEALab-ToolBox) you will find the repo with all the tools. There you can suggest new tools,report bugs and more under the "issues" page. If you want to create a new set of tools:

1. Create new branch
2. Create new folder following the current structure
3. Add your tools to the new folder
4. Request a merge
